The Sun's location is fixed, and its focal points (+ae and -ae) are at these coordinates. On the other hand, 
as the Earth rotates around the sun, its "X" and "Y" coordinate values change continuously. These values 
are determined by the following equations: X=a Cos(t) and Y=b Sin(t), and as time passes, the value of "t" 
increases as well at a constant speed, causing the Earth's "X" and "Y" coordinate to change and resulting 
in the Kepler Motion between the Sun and Earth
